/*Builder pattern is used to create complex objects that internally uses other objects.
Using constructor to create object mandates user to pass all parameters of constructors,even if 
user does not require it.Instead to exposing multiple constructor's of multiple field to create
objects, its better to provide user to set require fields dynamically and build the required object.
This way user can also mandate certain mandatory fields in constructor also.
This is what builder pattern does.
More over it hides the building implementation and provide the object based on user configuration.*/
